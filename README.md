## Overview
Here is the Net game,

This game uses a 5x5 grid, where each cell contains pieces representing pipes or cables. These pieces can be rotated a quarter turn to the right or left. They come in different shapes: terminations, straight segments, elbows, T-junctions, or crosses, with orientations facing north, east, south, or west. Each piece is built from arms extending from the center to its edges, called half-edges.
Good luck!

## Play

There are different ways to play the game. To generate executables for playing, run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will create two executables:

- To play the base game:
```./game_text [game_to_load]```

- To create a random game:
```./game_random <nb_rows> <nb_cols> <wrapping> <nb_empty> <nb_extra> <shuffle> [<filename>]```

## Commands

The available commands are:
- ```c I J``` Rotates the piece at row I and column J clockwise
- ```a I J``` Rotates the piece at row I and column J counterclockwise
- ```r``` Resets the game grid
- ```z``` Undo the last move
- ```y``` Redo the undone move
- ```q``` Quit the game in disgrace
- ```h``` Display help
